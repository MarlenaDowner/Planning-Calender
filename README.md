# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The app run's in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The app will allow any user to keep track of their day while on the go. The app will save important events such as meetings, appointments ect in a colour coded guid for visualisation.


## Apps functionality:

* Display's the current day and time at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
* Save's the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page
